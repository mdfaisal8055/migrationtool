Its format has evolved, but the basics remain: Answer trivia questions to win what could be very big bucks. Safety nets along the way guarantee sums that can't be lost once a contestant reaches certain thresholds -- and players can quit any time, but going for the million carries the risk of losing hundreds of thousands with one wrong answer. Contestants get &quot;lifelines&quot; to help reach the top." EpisodeNumber="8" Type="Program" />
